# X-Ray Image Segmentation using U-Nets
In this article, we shall look at using U-Nets for image segmentation. The link to the blog on Medium is as follows: [X-Ray Image Segmentation using U-Nets](https://medium.com/@Prith_Sharma/x-ray-image-segmentation-using-u-nets-518b51aa0cb5).
Also, do check out the [code](https://github.com/PRITH-S07/Lung-segmentation-using-U-Net) for this article! Hope you'll like it.

## What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning , as IBM defines it is “an attempt to mimic the human brain albeit far from matching its ability, enabling systems to cluster data and make predictions with incredible accuracy”.

It is essentially a Machine Learning technique that helps teach computers how to learn by example, something which is an innate quality possessed by humans.
