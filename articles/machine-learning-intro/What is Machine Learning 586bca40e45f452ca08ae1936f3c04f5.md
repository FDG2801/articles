# What is Machine Learning?

Most of the times Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are used as if they were the same thing, but they are not.  

**Artificial Intelligence** is a technology that solves computational problems by imitating human behavior. **Machine Learning**, on the other hand, is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows machines to learn from historical data in order to find patterns from the past and make assumptions about new data. Again, **Deep Learning** is a subfield of Machine Learning based on Artificial Neural Networks, that are computational analytical tool inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way biological neurons transfer informations to one another.

Sometimes the people tend to confuse Machine Learning with Data Mining, but theyâ€™re not exactly the same. **Data Mining** is the process of finding existing patterns on the data and it it typically performed on data warehouses. Machine Learning on the other hand, tries to go a bit further, extracting knowledge from the available data that will be leveraged for making future predictions.

## Machine Learning approaches

Based on the problem we are dealing with, we may rely on different machine learning approaches. The four main approaches are the following ones:

- **Supervised Learning :** machine learning task that consists of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on some (input,output) pairs on the training data. Here we can find techniques such as Classification or Regression.
- **Unsupervised Learning :** machine learning task that consists of detecting patterns on the data without pre-existing labels to learn from. Here we have techniques as Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction.
- **Semi Supervised Learning**: machine learning task that consists of learning from a large amount of unlabelled data and from a small subset of labelled data. The small labeled dataset will be used for training a simple model that will make inference towards the unlaballed data, and finally, a stronger model will be fed with all the labeled data.
